## Palindrome Partitioning

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

### Example:

    Input: "aab"
    Output:
    [
      ["aa","b"],
      ["a","a","b"]
    ]

# What I learned
***

Thanks to what we saw in class, I was able to indentify that to solve this problem effectively, I would need to use dynamic programming. Of course, it can be solved by generating every possible permutation, but that would take too long. It is better to generate smaller solutions and use them to build bigger ones. I did not have time to formulate a recursive interpretation of the problem, but I believe that using a matrix that stores built palindromes could help.
