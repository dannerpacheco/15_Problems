## Score of Parentheses

Given a balanced parentheses string S, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

() has score 1
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
 

### Example 1:

    Input: "()"
    Output: 1

### Example 2:

    Input: "(())"
    Output: 2

### Example 3:

    Input: "()()"
    Output: 2

### Example 4:

    Input: "(()(()))"
    Output: 6
 

Note:

S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
2 <= S.length <= 50

# What I learned
***
It was a little difficult to understand this problem, and in the end I am not sure if I understand correctly what it is asking for. If I could I would ask for clarification on the scoring system for nested parentheses. In any case, whenever I see a problem with parentheses I always think stacks, and in this case I think two can be used; one to identify the correctness of parentheses, the other one to indentify the level of "nestedness".
